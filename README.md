# A Pizza Perfection

A Pizza Perfection is a website which gives the user information on the history of two main types of pizza, these being Neopolitan and Romana. The website will explain the differences between the two allowing the user to choose which they prefer and try them at home.

There will be a section for users to provide feedback and topping inspirational ideas.

## User Stories

- Provide information on Romana and Neopolitan Pizza
- Provide user differences between the two pizzas
- Provide images to inspire the user
- Provide a method of voting for a favourite type of pizza

## Initial Framework

Before starting the website I used a framework design tool called [Balsamic](https://balsamiq.com/) to mockup an initial design idea.

### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - 
- CSS
  -
  

## Bugs Fixed

### No Opener
  * Spelt the rel - noopener incorrectly so was flagged on validation and corrected

### Degrees Symbol
  * For both degrees fahrenhiet and degrees celsius the symbol was copied in. When validation this showed as an error. Repleced with HTML code which fixed the issue.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub) 

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
