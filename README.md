# A Pizza Perfection

A Pizza Perfection is a website which gives the user information on the history of two main types of pizza, these being Neopolitan and Romana. The website will explain the differences between the two allowing the user to choose which they prefer and try them at home.

There will be a section for users to provide feedback and topping inspirational ideas.

## User Stories

- Provide information on Romana and Neopolitan Pizza
- Provide user differences between the two pizzas
- Provide images to inspire the user
- Provide a method of voting for a favourite type of pizza

## Initial Framework

Before starting the website I used a framework design tool called [Balsamic](https://balsamiq.com/) to mockup an initial design idea.
